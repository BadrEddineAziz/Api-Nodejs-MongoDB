# Api-Nodejs-MongoDB
This example project demonstrates how to build a complete RESTful API with CRUD operations using Node.js, Express, and Mongoose to interact with a MongoDB database. The API will allow users to perform standard CRUD operations on a collection that stores data about certain entities, such as users, products, or any other entity you choose.
